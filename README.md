- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zylacone
- 👀 I’m interested in software development on Android for Android.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Android in Java with Sketchware Pro. It was two years ago when I started banging my head on the hardened steel Sketchware wall, but the free version I found was incapable of anything but useless apps. 
Now I'ld like to finally get going with this endeavor.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Think I need to just focus on learning for now.

- 📫 How to reach me ...
